# User Guide

Welcome to the ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops user guide: this side of the documentation
is to provide a high-level and conceptual understanding of the philosophy
and supported features in `nvalchemiops`.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to install ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops:

```bash
$ pip install nvalchemi-toolkit-ops
```

Make sure it is importable:

```bash
$ python -c "import nvalchemiops; print(nvalchemiops.__version__)"
```

Try out some of the API; a good place to start is to compute
the neighbor matrix (or equivalently, list):

```python
import torch
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import cell_list

# Create atomic system data
positions = torch.randn(1000, 3, device='cuda')  # 1000 atoms
cell = torch.eye(3, device='cuda').unsqueeze(0) * 10.0  # 10x10x10 unit cell
pbc = torch.tensor([True, True, True], device='cuda')  # PBC
cutoff = 2.5  # Cutoff radius in Angstroms

# Compute neighbor matrix (default format)
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shifts = cell_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell, pbc
)

# Or get neighbor list (COO format) for graph neural networks
neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr, shifts = cell_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell, pbc, return_neighbor_list=True
)
source_indices = neighbor_list[0]
target_indices = neighbor_list[1]

print(f"Found {neighbor_list.shape[1]} neighbor pairs")
# neighbor_ptr is a CSR-style pointer; compute num_neighbors from it
num_neighbors = neighbor_ptr[1:] - neighbor_ptr[:-1]
print(f"Average neighbors per atom: {num_neighbors.float().mean():.1f}")
```
