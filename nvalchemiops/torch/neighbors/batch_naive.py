    Identifies all atom pairs within a specified cutoff distance for multiple

    For efficiency, this function supports in-place modification of pre-allocated tensors.

    This function does not introduce CUDA graph breaks for non-PBC systems.
    For PBC systems, pre-compute unit shifts to avoid CUDA graph breaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms, 3), dtype=torch.float32 or torch.float64
        Concatenated atomic coordinates for all systems in Cartesian space.
        Each row represents one atom's (x, y, z) position.
        Must be wrapped into the unit cell if PBC is used.
    cutoff : float
        Cutoff distance for neighbor detection in Cartesian units.
        Must be positive. Atoms within this distance are considered neighbors.
    batch_idx : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms,), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        System index for each atom. Atoms with the same index belong to
        the same system and can be neighbors. Must be in sorted order.
        If not provided, assumes all atoms belong to a single system.
    batch_ptr : torch.Tensor, shape (num_systems + 1,), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Cumulative atom counts defining system boundaries.
        System i contains atoms from batch_ptr[i] to batch_ptr[i+1]-1.
        If not provided and batch_idx is provided, it will be computed automatically.
    pbc : torch.Tensor, shape (num_systems, 3), dtype=torch.bool, optional
        Periodic boundary condition flags for each dimension of each system.
        True enables periodicity in that direction. Default is None (no PBC).
    cell : torch.Tensor, shape (num_systems, 3, 3), dtype=torch.float32 or torch.float64, optional
        Cell matrices defining lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates.
        Required if pbc is provided. Default is None.
    max_neighbors : int, optional
        Maximum number of neighbors per atom. Must be positive.
        If exceeded, excess neighbors are ignored.
        Must be provided if neighbor_matrix is not provided.
    half_fill : bool, optional
        If True, only store half of the neighbor relationships to avoid double counting.
        Another half could be reconstructed by swapping source and target indices and inverting unit shifts.
        If False, store all neighbor relationships. Default is False.
    fill_value : int | None, optional
        Value to fill the neighbor matrix with. Default is total_atoms.
    return_neighbor_list : bool, optional - default = False
        If True, convert the neighbor matrix to a neighbor list (idx_i, idx_j) format by
        creating a mask over the fill_value, which can incur a performance penalty.
        We recommend using the neighbor matrix format,
        and only convert to a neighbor list format if absolutely necessary.
    neighbor_matrix : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms, max_neighbors), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Optional pre-allocated tensor for the neighbor matrix.
        Must be provided if max_neighbors is not provided.
    neighbor_matrix_shifts : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms, max_neighbors, 3), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Optional pre-allocated tensor for the shift vectors of the neighbor matrix.
        Must be provided if max_neighbors is not provided and pbc is not None.
    num_neighbors : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms,), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Optional pre-allocated tensor for the number of neighbors in the neighbor matrix.
        Must be provided if max_neighbors is not provided.
    shift_range_per_dimension : torch.Tensor, shape (num_systems, 3), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Optional pre-allocated tensor for the shift range in each dimension for each system.
    shift_offset : torch.Tensor, shape (num_systems + 1,), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Optional pre-allocated tensor for the cumulative sum of number of shifts for each system.
    total_shifts : int, optional
        Total number of shifts.
        Pass in to avoid reallocation for pbc systems.
    max_atoms_per_system : int, optional
        Maximum number of atoms per system.
        If not provided, it will be computed automatically. Can be provided to avoid CUDA synchronization.

    Returns
    -------
    results : tuple of torch.Tensor
        Variable-length tuple depending on input parameters. The return pattern follows:

        - No PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors)``
        - No PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr)``
        - With PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, neighbor_matrix_shifts)``
