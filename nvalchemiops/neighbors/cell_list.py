    Constructs a spatial decomposition data structure for efficient neighbor searching
    using pure warp operations. This function launches warp kernels to organize atoms

        OUTPUT: Periodic boundary crossings for each atom.

        OUTPUT: Number of atoms in each cell. Must be zeroed by caller before first use.

        OUTPUT: Starting index in cell_atom_list for each cell's atoms.

        Warp dtype (wp.float32, wp.float64, or wp.float16).
    device : str
        Warp device string (e.g., 'cuda:0', 'cpu').

    Notes
    -----
    - This is a low-level warp interface. Caller must ensure atoms_per_cell_count is zeroed.
    - atoms_per_cell_count must be zeroed before calling this function.
    - This function handles the cumsum internally using wp.utils.array_scan.
    - For framework bindings, use the torch/jax wrappers instead.
